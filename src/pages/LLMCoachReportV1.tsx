              Great effort on your 5.2 km run today! Overall, your pacing was consistent. I've analyzed your
              biomechanics and how your body handled the load, and there are a few interesting points to discuss to help
              you keep running strong and injury-free.

                  During this run, your <strong>pelvic stability</strong> was generally good, but I noticed a slight
                  increase in your <strong>right pelvic drop</strong> (avg 5.2째 in the last km vs. 3.8째 earlier). This
                  often happens with fatigue and can put extra strain on your right knee, which did show a{" "}
                  <strong>higher peak force</strong> (2.8x body weight) compared to your left.

                <p className="mb-2">
                  We want to keep an eye on that. Your <strong>hip flexion</strong> on both sides (avg 22.5째 L, 21.9째 R)
                  was in a healthy range, showing good power generation.

                  In terms of muscle effort, your <strong>quadriceps and glutes</strong> did most of the work, which is
                  expected. However, the <strong>load on your left calf</strong> seems a bit higher than usual.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-2">
                  Combined with the pelvic drop, this puts you at a slight risk for ITB discomfort if it becomes a
                  consistent pattern. For now, the overall risk is <strong>moderate</strong>.

                  So, to help with that pelvic stability and knee load, I recommend adding{" "}
                  <strong>Glute Bridges</strong> to your routine. They're great for strengthening those key supporting
                  muscles.

              <strong>Pelvic drop</strong> is measured by the 'pelvic_list_angle_avg' from your sensors, which tracks
