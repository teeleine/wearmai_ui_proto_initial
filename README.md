# WearMai UI Prototype

A modern, responsive UI prototype for the WearMai mobile application, built with React and TypeScript.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the frontend implementation of the WearMai mobile application UI prototype. The project is built with modern web technologies and follows best practices for component architecture and state management.

## ðŸŽ¨ Project Context â€“ Initial UI Prototype
This repository features the exploratory, mid-fidelity UI prototype for the runner coaching interface, built using React, Tailwind CSS, and CDN-based libraries.

The goal of this version was to rapidly prototype and test various screen layouts, interaction flows, and information hierarchies. The interface includes over 11 distinct screens with multiple variants, enabling users to engage with an interactive wireframe that simulates the coaching experience.

This version was intentionally exploratory â€” focusing on:

Information architecture

Visual hierarchy

Component structure

Tone of feedback presentation

It allowed for quick iteration based on user input, helping the research team gather early insights into usability and interface preferences before committing to high-fidelity development.
