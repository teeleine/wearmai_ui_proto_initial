# WearMai UI Prototype

A modern, responsive UI prototype for the WearMai mobile application, built with React and TypeScript.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the frontend implementation of the WearMai mobile application UI prototype. The project is built with modern web technologies and follows best practices for component architecture and state management.

## ðŸš€ Project Context â€“ Refined Back-End Prototype
This repository houses the second, improved version of the back-end system built for the LLM-based running coach interface. Like the initial prototype, it was developed in Python and supports both Gemini and OpenAI models, with extensibility for other LLMs.

This refined version incorporates direct feedback from users of the initial prototype, addressing key issues such as model accuracy, interaction flow, and feedback clarity. Enhancements include:

Speech recognition support

Improved LLM response quality

Cleaner, more structured feedback outputs

Basic data visualisation capabilities

The prototype serves as a testbed for enhanced interaction between time-series running data and LLM-generated coaching responses, aiming to improve the quality and contextual relevance of system feedback.

It was created to evaluate how the improved features perform in comparison to the first prototype, and to iteratively advance the LLM-runner communication interface based on user-centered design principles.
